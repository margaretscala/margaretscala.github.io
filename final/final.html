    Corporal Robbie Wright works hard to give policing a better name
</header>


  <body>


   <p> Around 2016, a man sat in the Baltimore County Police precinct for four hours. In his full tactical gear, a gun strapped to his belt and his title plastered across the bullet proof vest he wore, he played a Blue’s Clues video game. Sitting on the lap of Officer Robbie Wright was a young child, whose father had just been arrested for reckless driving while they were strapped in the backseat. After calling around, trying to find a family member to take care of the child, Officer Wright decided to take the babysitting gig upon himself, and enjoyed a few hours of video games on the iPad, trying to create a scene of normalcy for a child who probably won’t remember this interaction by next week. Corporal Wright smiles and laughs about this moment, years later, remembering it as one of the happiest moments he’s had on the job as a police officer for Baltimore County. </p>

	<p>Corporal Wright joined the Baltimore County Police Department in 2011, and officially finished his academy training and became an officer in 2012. He was assigned to patrol the Pikesville area, about 20 minutes outside of Baltimore. Wright worked the Pikesville beat for about eight or nine years, until he was promoted to Corporal which moved him to supervise at the Dundalk precinct, where he stayed for about a year and a half until he joined the recruitment team for Baltimore County. “I’ve always had an interest in recruitment from very early on, I would say,” said Wright. Growing up, Wright watched his father come home as an officer of the Baltimore County Police Department for 30 years, so after growing up with this agency, it only seemed right that he’d then help it grow. </p>

    <blockquote>“it was a trend, 2020 hits: interest in policing goes way down. No one wants to be a police officer. So, a lot of police agencies, us included, we're in a situation where our numbers are down, and we're having heavy attrition for a variety of reasons,”</blockquote>

	<p>Growing the Baltimore County Police Department hasn’t been easy. “it was a trend, 2020 hits: interest in policing goes way down. No one wants to be a police officer. So, a lot of police agencies, us included, we're in a situation where our numbers are down, and we're having heavy attrition for a variety of reasons,” says Wright. This instance isn’t unique among Baltimore offices, in Prince George’s County, Baltimore County and Baltimore City, police employment dropped between 1 and 4% from 2019 to 2021 in general, according to Police Employment data from the FBI. Wright understands why people may not be applying anymore, especially with instances like George Floyd and Freddie Gray shaking people’s confidence in the police even more. “If you want to do this job, want to be a police officer, but you are concerned about how police treat, and it can be any race, but let's say if you're concerned that you're how police treat black people, come onto the job and help us change that perception. Help us fix that, be the officer that, if you say that you're not happy to see treatment of police or treatment of people from police, then be the police that treats people well. Be the police that does the right thing. Be the police that sets the good example. Be the one that makes the change,” says Wright.</p>

	<p>Wright works hard to make sure that every individual who has worries about the police or worries about joining the force be heard and is ready to answer any question a potential recruit may have. He also approaches each job fair and each individual who may stop by his table with the hopes that they do what’s best for them. “This is a great career, this is a great agency, but make sure you gather, do your research, and make an informed decision,” says Wright. </p>

<p>His approach for recruiting is just that-approach. At every job fair or every booth he runs, he makes sure to stand in front of the table and talk to everyone who walks by to try and gain either an interest or just let them know that the option is here for them. At a recent career fair at the Community College of Baltimore County, Essex campus, Wright was the only officer standing in front of his booth, and that showed results. Despite a slow day, he got over 15 students to take a flyer after hearing what Baltimore County could do for them, and he got 5 students to give him their information to receive updates on career options, one of whom applied that same day to their internship program. The recruitment program adopted this technique after 2020, seeing that they weren’t getting the thousands of applications that they had been getting in years past. Instead of sitting sternly behind a table, waiting for people to stop, they make themselves available, opening a dialogue to hopefully gain some traction with their potential recruits. </p>

	<p>Wright’s techniques have shown real growth, with applications being up 40% since January of 2023. But Wright doesn’t only measure their success by the number of applicants, “We are having more schools reach out to us saying ‘hey look, we hear you guys are doing this. We want you guys coming out or schools more. We have community groups saying hey, we know you guys are committed. We would love for you to come speak at our church event.’” Having a better image of Baltimore Policing in general is really what Wright finds as rewarding in his field. In fact, he doesn’t count his most successful recruiting event as an event where they got the most applicants, but rather where they had the most community engagement and saw people really enjoy the time they spent with the police. </p>

       <p>The event was a Trunk or Treat at the Baltimore County PD headquarters in October of 2022. For two months beforehand, officers were flooding Baltimore County, stapling up flyers, sticking up lawn signs, and spreading the word of the free event for families to attend. Since there was no RSVP or no real verbal agreement from anyone, on the day of the officers weren’t even sure that they would have any visitors. However, as the day moved on, more and more families flooded the parking lot, picking up candies and watching the aviation department landing a helicopter. By the end of the event, Wright recalls over 200 people passing through, nearly draining the candy supply, “I would say that was probably our most successful and our most rewarding because yes, the purpose of the hiring events are to get people to apply, get them through the process and hire them at the end of the day, but the community part is an important part of that and for the vision of getting the community out I think that was like amazingly successful.”</p>
